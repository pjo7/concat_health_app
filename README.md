# How the tool works
•In tense situations where there are sudden physiological changes, such as fluctuations in heart rate and perspiration, it is often an indication of underlying issues like changes in blood pressure or sudden spikes in diabetes as is ordained by chemical imbalances in your brain.The sensor would be capable of detecting sweat (by sensing its biomarkers i.e constituents) and changes in heart rate. Whenever a rapid change in either of these indicators occurs, the sensor would alert the app, which would then vibrate and provide notifications giving the user the choice to deploy voice notes of de-escalation techniques, validating statements, affirmations,and reminders to breathe and other meditation directions.
This signal can help individuals who are triggered, as is often the case with anxiety sufferers, to regain their focus and prevent them from spiraling or zoning out.
